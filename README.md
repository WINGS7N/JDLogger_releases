# JDLogger_releases

## What is JDLogger
JDLogger â€” Minecraft Death Logger Spigot/Paper plugin.
It allows you check player's on death inventory,
armor, TPS, ping, XYZ and other more.

_It was deleted from SpigotMC because JDLogger using
not allowed type of obfuscation. JDLogger and other modules of it doesn't contain any
backdoors in code. This project is Closed Source Code because I planned add some donate features,
but most likely I will make this plugin Open Source Code soon._
